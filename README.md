    The end-goal is to be able to stream real-time WAV audio from PCM interface
    hw cleanly over a network (local/web) so-as to use in a DAW session in
    live takes. Not yet settled on the implementation details, and as this is
    a hobby side-project, this repo will change alot, best to just ignore it
    until I do a propper release. (IF I do a propper release!)
